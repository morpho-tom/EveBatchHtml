        <h1>Louis Leo Prima </h1>
        <p>
          Louis Leo Prima (/ˈluːi ˈpriːmə/; December 7, 1910 – August 24,
          1978)[1] was an American trumpeter, singer, entertainer, and
          bandleader. While rooted in New Orleans jazz, swing music, and jump
          blues, Prima touched on various genres throughout his career: he
          formed a seven-piece New Orleans–style jazz band in the late 1920s,
          fronted a swing combo in the 1930s and a big band group in the 1940s,
          helped to popularize jump blues in the late 1940s and early to mid
          1950s, and performed frequently as a Vegas lounge act beginning in the
          1950s. From the 1940s through the 1960s, his music further encompassed
          early R&B and rock 'n' roll, boogie-woogie, and Italian folk music,
          such as the tarantella. Prima made prominent use of Italian music and
          language in his songs, blending elements of his Italian and Sicilian
          identity with jazz and swing music. At a time when ethnic musicians
          were discouraged from openly stressing their ethnicity, Prima's
          conspicuous embrace of his Sicilian ethnicity opened the doors for
          other Italian-American and ethnic American musicians to display their
          ethnic roots. Prima is also known for providing the voice for the
          orangutan King Louie in the 1967 Disney film The Jungle Book. Early
          life Louis Leo Prima[2] was from a musical Italian American family in
          New Orleans, Louisiana. His father, Anthony Prima, was the son of
          Leonardo Di Prima, a Sicilian immigrant from Salaparuta, while his
          mother, Angelina Caravella, had emigrated from the island of Ustica
          north of Sicily as a baby.[3] Prima was the second child of four; his
          older brother, Leon, was born in 1907, while his sisters Elizabeth and
          Marguerite were younger. Marguerite died when she was three years old.
          Leon, Louis, and Elizabeth were all baptized at St. Ann's Parish. They
          lived in a house at 1812 St. Peter Street in New Orleans.[4] Prima's
          mother was a music lover, and she made sure that each child played an
          instrument. Louis was assigned the violin and started out playing at
          St. Ann's Parish.[4] He became interested in jazz when he heard black
          musicians, including Louis Armstrong. Italian immigrants,
          Italian-Americans, and African-Americans in New Orleans at the time
          frequently socialized together in the same clubs and bars. Local clubs
          tailored to the ostracized Italian community, such as Matranga's, Joe
          Segrettas, Tonti's Social Club, and Lala's Big 25, were all
          Italian-American clubs owned and operated by Italians; African
          Americans were always welcomed in these clubs and often played music
          and fraternized with Italians and Italian-Americans. Prima's interest
          in jazz was sparked while frequenting these clubs and observing black
          and Italian jazz artists playing together.[4] According to author
          Garry Boulard in his book Louis Prima, Prima paid attention to the
          music coming from clubs and watched his older brother Leon play the
          cornet.[4] When Leon left the house to spend one summer in Texas,
          Prima practiced continuously on his worn-down cornet. He formed a band
          in 1924 with his childhood friends "Candy" Candido (bass), Irving
          Fazola (clarinet) and Johnny Viviano (drums).[4] Prima attended Jesuit
          High School but transferred to Warren Easton High, then a boys'
          school, in the fall of 1926.[4] At Warren Easton, he played with the
          "Eastonites", the school band. In 1927, he partnered with fellow
          musician Frank Federico and the pair played at "The Whip", a run-down
          French Quarter nightclub. By the spring of 1928, Prima decided he
          would become a professional musician.[4] Career After finishing high
          school in New Orleans, Prima had a few unsuccessful gigs, including
          when he joined the Ellis Stratako Orchestra in 1929.[4] Prima,
          Federico and saxophonist Dave Winstein drove to Florida for a gig but
          no one showed up. They made it to a relative's house, where they were
          given money for gas and a meal. Prima did not give up. He joined
          Joseph Cherniavsky's Orchestra in 1929 at Jefferson Parish. He got a
          temporary job playing on the steamship Capital that docked on Canal
          Street.[4] Although the Capital did not provide him with a big break
          for his career, he did meet his first wife Louise Polizzi there. They
          married on June 25, 1929.[4] From 1931 to 1932, Prima occupied his
          time by performing in the Avalon Club owned by his brother Leon. His
          first break was when Lou Forbes hired him for daily afternoon and
          early evening shows at The Saenger.[4] New York City New York was an
          attraction for hungry musicians during the Great Depression. Guy
          Lombardo met Prima while he was performing at club Shim Sham during
          the Mardi Gras season of 1934.[4] Prima and his New Orleans Gang
